# Make the gradle wrapper executable. This essentially downloads a copy of
# Gradle to build the project with.
# https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html
# It is expected that any modern gradle project has a wrapper
before_script:
    - chmod +x gradlew

# We redirect the gradle user home using -g so that it caches the
# wrapper and dependencies.
# https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_command_line.html
#
# Unfortunately it also caches the build output so
# cleaning removes reminants of any cached builds.
# The assemble task actually builds the project.
# If it fails here, the tests can't run.
